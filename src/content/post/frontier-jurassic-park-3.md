## Post-Launch

To protect long-term deliverability and continuously improve performance, the sequence includes built-in A/B testing on Email #1, progressive engagement scoring to suppress cold leads before Email #3/#4, automatic complaint/unsubscribe monitoring with immediate suppression, and a post-campaign warmup/cooldown period where send volume is gradually reduced. After the launch week, non-buyers are moved to a 30-day re-engagement flow while purchasers enter a dedicated owner sequence focused on DLC and retention - ensuring the sender reputation remains pristine for future launches.
