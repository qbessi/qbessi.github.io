Choosing the right tools is essential for my workflow. While many developers favour Visual Studio Code (VSCode), I believe that both VIM and Neovim offer distinct advantages that make them better choices for our field. Here’s why VIM and Neovim stand out.

## 1. Faster Editing with VIM and Neovim

VIM uses modal editing, allowing you to edit text much faster once you get the hang of it. This keyboard-focused approach helps me stay focused when working on scripts or configuration files. Neovim takes this a step further with enhanced features that make editing even smoother.

## 2. Lightweight and Quick

In DevOps, we often work on servers with limited resources. VIM is lightweight and opens quickly, even on older machines. Neovim also maintains this efficiency while adding modern features. In contrast, VSCode can be slow and resource-hungry, which can interrupt my workflow.

## 3. Customise Your Experience

Both VIM and Neovim are highly customisable. I can create shortcuts, macros, and even write my own scripts to tailor the experience to my needs. Neovim offers additional plugin options through LazyVim, making it easier to set up and manage your environment. This flexibility is crucial when juggling various projects.

## 4. Seamless Terminal Integration

A lot of my work happens in the terminal, and both VIM and Neovim integrate perfectly with it. I can edit files directly in my terminal session, making it easy to make quick changes without switching between applications. This saves time and keeps my workflow smooth.

## 5. Valuable Skills for the Future

Though VIM and Neovim have a steeper learning curve, mastering them is worth the effort. The skills I learn are applicable across many platforms and tools. Unlike some modern IDEs that might fade over time, VIM and Neovim remain relevant and useful in the long run.

## 6. A Supportive Community

The VIM and Neovim communities are active and helpful. There are plenty of forums, tutorials, and resources available, which means I can always find support or learn new tips. The community around LazyVim also provides helpful insights and configuration tips, enhancing the overall experience.

## Conclusion

While VSCode has its advantages, I find that VIM and Neovim are better fits for my needs as a DevOps engineer. Their speed, efficiency, and customisation options allow me to work more productively. If you’re considering which editor to use, I highly recommend giving VIM or Neovim a try. With some practice, you might discover that they are powerful tools for your DevOps tasks.
