# Why I Switched to Debian from macOS: A Journey into Linux for DevOps

As a developer, my journey into the world of Linux began with a desire to learn, experiment, and ultimately deepen my understanding of systems that power much of the internet. After using macOS for several years, I decided to make the switch to Debian, and I haven't looked back since. Here's a reflection on my motivations for this change and why I believe Linux, particularly Debian, is better suited for DevOps.

## Embracing the Shell

One of the primary reasons for my transition was the need to immerse myself in the command line. While macOS offers a robust Unix-based environment, I found that using Debian forced me to engage with the shell on a daily basis. This immersion has improved my skills and confidence in using terminal commands, scripting, and automation—essential tools for any DevOps professional.

## Package Management and Software Freedom

Debian's package management system is a significant draw for developers. With tools like APT (Advanced Package Tool), installing, upgrading, and managing software becomes an efficient and straightforward process. I appreciate the vast repository of packages available, providing me with access to the latest software and tools without the restrictions often found in macOS.

Furthermore, Debian embodies the spirit of open-source software, allowing me the freedom to modify and distribute my tools as needed. This contrasts with macOS, where software is often closed and proprietary, limiting customisation options.

## Stability and Reliability

Debian is renowned for its stability, particularly the "Stable" release branch. In a DevOps environment where uptime and reliability are paramount, this feature is crucial. Unlike macOS, which can introduce significant changes with major updates, Debian’s approach ensures that systems remain consistent and dependable, reducing the risk of unexpected issues during critical operations.

## Customisation and Control

Switching to Debian has granted me greater control over my environment. I can customise everything from the desktop environment to system services, tailoring my setup to perfectly suit my development needs. This level of personalisation is often constrained in macOS, where the user experience is carefully curated, sometimes at the expense of flexibility.

## Community and Support

The Debian community is vibrant and supportive. The wealth of documentation, forums, and mailing lists has been invaluable as I navigated this new operating system. While macOS has its share of communities, I’ve found that the open-source ethos of Debian fosters a spirit of collaboration and knowledge-sharing that is hard to replicate.

## Learning and Growth

Ultimately, the switch to Debian has been about personal and professional growth. By embracing Linux, I have challenged myself to learn new skills, troubleshoot issues independently, and adapt to a different way of thinking about software and systems. This growth mindset is critical in the fast-evolving field of DevOps, where continuous learning is not just encouraged but essential.

## Conclusion

My switch from macOS to Debian has been a transformative experience. The depth of knowledge I've gained, coupled with the advantages of using a powerful, open-source operating system, has made me a more capable developer. While both operating systems have their merits, for DevOps, I firmly believe that Debian offers a superior environment for learning, experimentation, and professional development.

If you’re considering a similar switch, I encourage you to take the plunge.
