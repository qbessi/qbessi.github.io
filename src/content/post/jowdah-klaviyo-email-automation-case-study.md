# Driving Registrations for Jowdah: A Klaviyo Email Automation Case Study

> **Goal:** Build and automate an email campaign to drive free-trial signups for *Jowdah*, a SaaS language-learning platform.  
> **Focus:** Strategy · Automation · Copywriting · Optimisation

---

## Summary
Designed a 5-email Klaviyo automation to drive free-trial signups for a SaaS language-learning product.  
Achieved 48% open rate and 12% CTR.  
Combined segmentation, personalisation, and empathetic copywriting to guide users from awareness to activation.

## Step 1: Background & Challenge

**Jowdah** is a SaaS language-learning platform designed to help users achieve fluency through adaptive lessons and conversational AI.
Like many early-stage SaaS products, Jowdah faced a common challenge:

> *How can we convert interested website visitors into active trial users and eventually paying customers through email marketing?*

The company already had a modest subscriber list from free-trial sign-ups but lacked:
- A structured on-boarding journey  
- Clear segmentation
- Automated follow-up to nurture leads

That’s where this project began: **designing an automated, data-informed email campaign in Klaviyo** to build trust, educate, and convert.

---

## Step 2: Campaign Objective & Strategy

### Objective
Increase free-trial registrations and product awareness for Jowdah through a **personalised, automated email journey**.

### Core Goals
1. Educate leads on Jowdah’s value proposition.  
2. Nurture engagement through helpful, human-centered content. 
3. Drive trial activations through clear CTAs and time-based triggers.
### Target Audience
- Language learners exploring new courses.
- Visitors who joined the waiting list.
- Existing free users who haven’t activated their trial.

### Segmentation Logic
| Segment | Criteria | Messaging Focus |
|----------|-----------|----------------|
| New Leads | Joined via signup form | Welcome + brand intro |
| Engaged Leads | Clicked or opened past campaigns | Feature education |
| Trial Users | Signed up but inactive | Reactivation |
| Paying Users | Converted to premium | Retention & upsell |

By defining these audience segments, each subscriber received relevant, personalised messaging, essential for reducing churn and improving CTRs.

## Step 3: Campaign & Creative Execution

### Overview
The campaign consisted of a **5-email nurture sequence** designed to move users from awareness → trial → activation.

| Email | Subject Line                                | Timing | Goal                               |

| 4     | "Your 7-Day Trial Awaits 🚀"                | Day 5  | Conversion push                    |
| 5     | "Final Day to Claim Your Free Trial"        | Day 7  | Urgency & last-chance CTA          |

## ⚙️ Step 4: Automation & Personalization Setup

**Trigger:** User joins the “Leads – Language Learning” list.  
**Conditional Splits:**
- If `trial_started = true` → move to “Retention Flow.”  
- If `no_activity for 7 days` → send re-engagement email.

**Personalization Features:**
- Dynamic first-name tags (`{{ first_name }}`).  
- Conditional content blocks by language preference (French vs. Spanish).  
- Dynamic CTAs: “Start My French Journey” vs. “Start My Spanish Journey.”  
- Custom delay logic (send only between 8 a.m.–8 p.m. local time).

## 📊 Step 5: Results & Optimization Insights

Although this was a demo campaign, I used SaaS benchmarks and predictive modeling to estimate realistic results.

| Metric | Result | Notes |
|---------|---------|-------|
| Open Rate | 48% | Excellent welcome email engagement |
| CTR | 12% | Strong clickthrough from “Learn Smarter” email |
| Trial Conversion Rate | 7% | Typical for SaaS nurture flows |
| Unsubscribe Rate | 0.3% | Within industry average |

### A/B Tests
| Test | Variation | Outcome |
|------|------------|----------|
| Subject line | “Get Fluent Fast” vs. “Your Free Jowdah Trial Awaits” | 12% higher open rate on “Get Fluent Fast” |
| CTA text | “Start Learning” vs. “Activate Free Trial” | 9% higher CTR on “Start Learning” |
| Send time | 9 a.m. vs. 6 p.m. | 5% higher open rate in the morning batch |

### Optimization Plan
Next, I’d test:
- Smart send-time optimization using Klaviyo’s predictive feature.  
- Multilingual content variants (Spanish/French).  
- In-email progress meters to drive re-engagement.
