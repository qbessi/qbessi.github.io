In recent years, the demand for cloud computing skills has skyrocketed, with businesses increasingly relying on cloud solutions for scalability, flexibility, and cost efficiency. As a result, many students are eager to pursue cloud certifications, believing these credentials alone will set them apart in the job market. However, this mindset often overlooks a crucial component of cloud proficiency: the ability to code.

## The Allure of Cloud Certifications

Cloud certifications, such as those offered by Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP), have gained immense popularity. They promise to validate oneâ€™s knowledge and skills in cloud services and architecture, making them attractive to students eager to bolster their CVs. While these certifications undoubtedly provide valuable insights into cloud technologies, they can inadvertently create a false sense of security.

Many students believe that simply acquiring a certification is enough to secure a position in the tech industry. However, this perception neglects the fact that real-world applications of cloud technology often require a deeper understanding of coding and software development principles.

## The Importance of Coding Skills

1. **Automation and Scripting**: A significant portion of cloud operations relies on automation. Tasks such as deploying applications, managing resources, and configuring environments often require scripting skills. Familiarity with languages like Python, Bash, or JavaScript is essential for creating scripts that can automate these processes, saving time and reducing human error.

2. **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: Modern cloud environments heavily utilise IaC tools such as Terraform and AWS CloudFormation. These tools allow developers to manage and provision cloud resources using code. Understanding how to write and manipulate this code is vital for optimising cloud infrastructure and ensuring efficient operations.

3. **Integration and Development**: Many cloud solutions involve integrating various services and APIs. A solid grasp of coding is essential for developing applications that can leverage these integrations effectively. Without coding skills, students may struggle to connect different components within the cloud ecosystem.

4. **Problem-Solving Skills**: Coding fosters critical thinking and problem-solving abilities. When students learn to code, they not only acquire technical skills but also develop the mindset needed to tackle complex challenges in cloud environments. This skill set is invaluable in any tech role.

5. **Career Advancement**: Employers increasingly seek candidates who possess both cloud certifications and coding skills. The ability to code can differentiate a candidate in a competitive job market, opening doors to more advanced roles and opportunities for career growth.

## Bridging the Gap

To ensure they are adequately prepared for the demands of the industry, students should not view cloud certifications as a standalone solution. Instead, they should actively seek to enhance their coding skills alongside their certification studies. Here are a few suggestions:

- **Take Coding Courses**: Enrol in programming courses that focus on languages relevant to cloud computing. Platforms like Codecademy, Coursera, and Udemy offer a range of options for all skill levels.

- **Engage in Projects**: Participate in real-world projects, whether through internships, hackathons, or personal endeavours. Building and deploying applications in a cloud environment will solidify coding skills and provide practical experience.

- **Join Community Groups**: Engage with online forums, meetups, and coding communities. Networking with peers and professionals can provide insights and mentorship opportunities that enhance learning.

- **Continuous Learning**: The tech industry is always evolving. Staying updated with the latest programming languages and cloud technologies is crucial for long-term success.

## Conclusion

While cloud certifications can provide a foundational understanding of cloud services, they are not a substitute for coding skills. As students prepare to enter the tech workforce, they must recognise the importance of learning how to code in conjunction with their cloud studies. By bridging this gap, they will be better equipped to thrive in the dynamic world of cloud computing and position themselves as valuable assets to potential employers. The future of cloud technology belongs to those who can not only understand the principles but also bring them to life through code.
