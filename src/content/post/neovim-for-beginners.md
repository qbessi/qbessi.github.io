Neovim is a modern, open-source text editor built as an extension of Vim, offering improved performance, better plugin support, and a more user-friendly configuration system. It’s especially popular among developers who value speed and customizability. LazyVim is a pre-configured Neovim setup that streamlines the configuration process by bundling popular plugins and sensible defaults, making it easier for users to get started with a powerful Neovim environment right out of the box

## Install Neovim

Before we begin we need to install Neovim before we can configure it. This is pretty simple on Mac OSX, Linux or Windows.

### Mac OSX

` brew install neovim `

### Linux

For Linux distributions, take a look at (this guide)[https://github.com/neovim/neovim/blob/master/INSTALL.md#linux] to install for your specific installations.

1. **AZ-900: Azure Fundamentals**  
   This certification offered a comprehensive overview of Microsoft Azure. I learned about core services, pricing models, and support options. It was essential for understanding the cloud environment I’ll be working in, especially as I look to integrate Azure into my current projects.

2. **MS-900: Microsoft 365 Fundamentals**  
   With MS-900, I delved into Microsoft 365 and its suite of productivity tools. Understanding how these tools enhance collaboration and productivity is invaluable, particularly as organisations increasingly adopt remote and hybrid work models.

3. **SC-900: Security, Compliance, and Identity Fundamentals**  
   Given the rising importance of security in tech, SC-900 helped me grasp the essentials of data protection and compliance. This knowledge is crucial for ensuring that any cloud solutions I work on are secure and meet regulatory requirements.

## How I Managed It

Balancing a full-time job while studying for these certifications was no small feat. I structured my study schedule by dedicating a few hours each evening and blocking out weekends for deeper dives into the material.

I made great use of online resources, especially Microsoft Learn, and following a number of Udemy video courses.

## What have I gained from this experience?

- **Strong Fundamentals**: I now have a solid understanding of cloud services, productivity tools, and security principles, which are essential as I shift my focus to cloud and DevOps roles.

- **Enhanced Employability**: These certifications have boosted my confidence in applying for positions that require expertise in Microsoft technologies. They demonstrate to potential employers that I’m committed to my professional growth in this new area.

- **Networking Opportunities**: The study groups I participated in introduced me to some great contacts. You never know where a conversation might lead or what insights you might gain from fellow professionals.

## What’s Next?

With AZ-900, MS-900, and SC-900 completed, I’m excited to continue my journey with Azure. These certifications have provided me with a strong foundation to explore more advanced topics and specialisations in Azure and Microsoft 365.
